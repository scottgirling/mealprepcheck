                <p>We compare the offerings of over 50 meal providers. We know many of these you'll never have heard of before. We also know it's long to check Google, Facebook and Trustpilot reviews when you just want tasty scran.</p>
                <p>That's why we've come up with RATING. RATING is an independent rating/score based on fact & opinion. RATING looks at objective facts by considering things like the number of meal options a provider offers - because lets be honest, no one wants the same meals every other week. RATING also looks at subjective opinions by aggregating the reviews of current and former customers on Google, Facebook & Trustpilot and providing an average.</p>
                <p>RATING is reviewed quarterly as we know providers often update their offerings and thus reviews can change month to month.</p>
