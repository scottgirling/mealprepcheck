                    </div>
                    <div class="accordion-answer">
                        <p>Heat & Eat meals are delivered already cooked - they just need to be popped in the oven or microwave to be heated up. This saves you the time having to prep and cook your meals, as well as cleaning afterwards. Heat & Eat dinners therefore tend to be a little dearer as they offer additional convenience.</p>
                        <p>Recipe Kits are delivered as a box with most of the necessary ingredients. Depending on your subscription, the veg may come pre chopped and you may still need to buy some ingredients, such as meat, separately. With Recipe Kits you still need to do the cooking, so if you enjoy cooking this is probably the option for you. Recipe Kits therefore tend to be slightly cheaper but offer a little less convenience.</p>

                    <div class="accordion-answer">
                        <p>RATING is an independent tool to support consumers in choosing a subscription by scoring each provider - think DEFAQTO ratings but for food. A provider's score is based on current and former reviews over various platforms (such as Google, Trustpilot and Facebook) as well as considering data such as the variety of meal options a provider is able to offer. RATING aims to provide a quick overview at a glance and each provider's score is reviewed regularly.</p>
